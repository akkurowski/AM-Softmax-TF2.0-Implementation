<p align="center" size='large'><b>An implementation of AM-Softmax Loss algorithm in TensorFlow 2.0<b></p>

<p>It is not easy to find an implementation of AM-Softmax algorithm, which is working just after cloning it from the repository. This is my attempt to develop such an algorithm. The script is prepared with intention of using it for carrying out deep metric learning for acoustic (musical) data.</p>
